Programming Language
Statically Typed:
explicit data type declaration
Type variable cannot be changed, usually compiled
Statically typed languages check the types and look for type errors during compile time.
Types checked before run-time
- Java
- C
- Go
- C#
- C++
Dynamically typed:
do not require explicit declaration
type variable can be changed, usually interpreted
Dynamically typed languages check the types and look for type errors during runtime.
Types checked on the fly, during execution
- Python
- PHP
- Javascript

Strong Typing:
Strong typing probably means that variables have a well-defined type and that 
there are strict rules about combining variables of different types in expressions

Strongly Typed: Will not be automatically converted from one type to another
- Go
- Python

Weak Typing:
Weakly (loosely) Typed: Will be automatically converted to one type to another: 
Weakly typed languages like JavaScript or Perl
- PHP
